**This mod is a small C# mod for the game called Celeste.**

It contains few features:

- **A grab counter**: Like the name says, this mod can count the number of grab. It handles the three mods of grabbing in the game and has an option to count or not the "holdables". The number of grab can see in direct in levels.
  
- **Fewest Grab Counter**: In the levels you can see the lowest number of grab you made to finish the level and update if you beat your record.

- **Journal Page**: Print in the journal in the game the record for each level in the game.

- **GrabBerry**: This strawberry is like a normal strawberry but it fly off when you grab if you are on the screen of the berry.

- **GoldenGrabBerry**: Same as the GrabBerry but fly off if you grab in the level.


**Installation**:

For the moment you need to clone the repository, install dotnet and build the project yourself, but I will look to post this mod on Gamebanana.
